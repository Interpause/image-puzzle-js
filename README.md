Image Puzzle game in pure JavaScript.

## Archive Note
I probably will not need a shifting pieces puzzle again. And if I do, I would probably not use someone else's work like this. I would also code it using jsx.

## Edits made in fork so far:
- Now mobile friendly!
- ^Using Polyfill code for drag & drop from github/bernardo-castilho
- Image scales based on phone sized
- Looks more modern

- Made everything centre aligned.
- Removed the timer, step counter, and correct image.
- Locked it to 4 sized grid.
